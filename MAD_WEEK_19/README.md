# Send an Email

> Develop an application to send and receive e-mail.

- Create a new project in **Android Studio** named **Email Sender** (name should me absolute because in `MainActivity.java` the imported package name is **emailsender**)
- Add the below `XML` code in `activity_main.xml` of your project.

```xml


```

- Now add the below `Java` code in `MainActivity.java` of your project.

```java


```

That's it now save the both files and run the app!

> **Note** :make sure to check the package name in java file `package com.example.emailsender;` if you got another name other than `emailsender` make sure to replace the first line of the code with yours.
