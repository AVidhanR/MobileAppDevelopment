# Android Table and Grid Layouts

> Design an Android application program that demonstrates the following: Table Layout and Grid Layout

- Create a new project in **Android Studio** named **`Table And Grid Layout`** (name should me absolute because in `MainActivity.java` the imported package name is **tableandgridlayout**)
- Add the below `XML` code in `activity_main.xml` of your project.

```xml

```

- Now add the below `Java` code in `MainActivity.java` of your project.

```java

```

That's it now save the both files and the app!

> **Note** :make sure to check the package name in java file `package com.example.tableandgridlayout;` if you got another name other than `tableandgridlayout` make sure to replace the first line of the code with yours.
